# Gitignore for packages/sdk
#
# Recommendation: ignore generated code under `src/client/` unless you
# want to commit the generated SDK to version control. If you prefer to
# keep generated files in the repo (for example to avoid running the
# generator in CI or for consumers), remove the `src/client/` entry.
